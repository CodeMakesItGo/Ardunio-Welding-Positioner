# Ardunio-Welding-Positioner
Arduino controlled rotary weld positioner

This project uses the Arduino Uno.

Haslip Cycle Works asked if I could make them a controller for their rotary weld positioner to be used with a tig welder. I was excited to help! However, we came across some EMF interference because of the tig welder high frequency start. 

Parts:
Arduino Uno
LCD Keypad Shield
CNC Single Axis TB6600 Stepper Motor Driver
4th Axis Hollow Shaft Rotary Table Router
